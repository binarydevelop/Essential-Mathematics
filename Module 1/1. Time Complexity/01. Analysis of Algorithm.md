## Analysis of Algorithm

#### Problem 1
- Given a number N, write a program to find sum of first N natural numbers.
>Example :
>    For N = 5 
>    ***Output***= 21
#### Solution
``` c++
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;
int sumOfNaturalNumbersUpto(int N){
    int sum = 0; 
    for(int i= 1; i<= N; i++){
        sum += i;
    }
    return sum;
}
int main(){

    cout<<sumofNaturalNumbersUpto(5);
    return 0;
}
```
Here the Equation comes to be `C1 + C2*N`. __How__??
>Intializing `sum = 0` is constant so `C1`
>then the loop will run N times adding `C2*N`

- Different Programmers might write different solutions to this program. Also they might be running faster on a machine with high performance, but finding a way to measure the effeciency of the program irrespective of the machine and other constraints such as language is known as __Asymptotic analysis.__ 

### What we do in Asymptotic Analysis?
 We measure order of growth of programs or algorithms in terms of input size.

> Example
> 
``` c++
int sumOfNaturalNumbersUpto(int N){
    return N * (N+1)/2
} //Using Formula
 ```
we get an equation like ***C1*** that is constant time. __How__??
If we give `N = 10000 it will do  10000 * (10000 + 1)/2`
and even if we give it `N = 10 it will do the same work and hence doesn't depend on the input size.`

>Constant work is one which will happen irrespective of input provided.

Now in another case 
``` c++
int sumOfNaturalNumbersUpto(int N){
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i<= N; i++){
        for(int j = 1; j<= i; j++ ){
            sum++;
        }
    }
    return sum;
} //Using Looping 
 ```
 Here the Equation comes `C1 + C2 * (N * N) + C3 `

### How to prove theoritically that your algorithm is faster?
For this we take large values of N which is the input size.
